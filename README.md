# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System
## 🌟 Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals determine the most suitable crop to plant based on various environmental and soil parameters. This system uses a trained machine learning model to provide crop recommendations to improve yield and optimize resource utilization.

## 🔍 Features
* Predictive Analysis: Recommends the most suitable crop based on input parameters.
* Data-Driven Insights: Utilizes historical data to provide accurate and reliable recommendations.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes features like soil type, pH level, rainfall, temperature, and other relevant agricultural parameters. The dataset should be stored in a CSV file format.
