Crop Recommendation System
Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals determine the most suitable crop to plant based on various environmental and soil parameters. This system uses a trained machine learning model to provide crop recommendations to improve yield and optimize resource utilization.

Features
Predictive Analysis: Recommends the most suitable crop based on input parameters.
Data-Driven Insights: Utilizes historical data to provide accurate and reliable recommendations.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes features like soil type, pH level, rainfall, temperature, and other relevant agricultural parameters. The dataset should be stored in a CSV file format.
